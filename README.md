# Avenger

Functionality:
- In an hour, I was able to implement range for ports but not ip addresses. I used the following link to determine integer representation to ip addresses: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html. 
- I have commented a block of code which errored out. If give more time, I would look for another implementation of range of ip address or debugged that piece of code.
